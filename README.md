### What I learned

After taking a 6 month break from coding and web development I thought this would be a neat little challenge to remove some of the rust. Unfortunatley 6 months was a bit too long and a lot of my skills have been forgotten as this proved to be a bit of a challenge ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I will continue moving forward to try and sharpen my mind to be able to get to the level I was this time 6 months ago.
